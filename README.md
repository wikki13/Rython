Rython
Rython is an R package designed to convert Python code to R code. It simplifies the process of translating Python scripts into their R equivalents, making it easier for users familiar with R to adapt Python code to R. The package provides a set of functions that map common Python constructs (e.g., imports, variables, functions) to their R counterparts.

Features
Python to R Code Translation: The core functionality of the package is to translate basic Python syntax into R, including variables, imports, functions, and basic control structures.
Import Translation: The package converts Python's import statements to the appropriate R library() calls, making it easy to switch between Python and R libraries.
Variable Conversion: Automatically converts Python variable assignments (e.g., x = [1, 2, 3]) into their R equivalents (e.g., x <- c(1, 2, 3)).
Function Definitions: Translates Python function definitions into R function syntax, making it easier to adapt Python code into R.
Boolean and None Translation: Converts Python booleans (True, False) and None into R equivalents (TRUE, FALSE, NULL).
Installation
You can install the Rython package from CRAN (once available) or directly from GitHub using the devtools package:

R
Copy code
# Install from GitHub (Development version)
devtools::install_github("wikki13/Rython")
Usage
To use the package, simply load it and call the translate_python_to_r() function, passing the Python code you want to translate as a string.

R
Copy code
# Example usage
library(Rython)

python_code <- "import numpy as np\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3])"
translated_code <- translate_python_to_r(python_code)

# View the translated R code
print(translated_code)
This will translate Python code like:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
Into R code:

r
Copy code
library(Matrix)
x <- array(c(1, 2, 3))
Future Developments
Enhanced Syntax Support: Plans to expand the translation to cover more complex Python features, such as classes, loops, conditionals, and exception handling.
Bi-directional Translation: Future versions may include a feature for converting R code back to Python, making it easier to work with both languages in parallel.
Optimizations and Improvements: Continued improvements to the accuracy of the translation, including handling edge cases and uncommon Python libraries.
Performance Enhancements: Optimizing the speed and efficiency of the translation process, especially for larger Python scripts.
